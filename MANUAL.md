# The YuTuTui! Manual

**English** · [한국어](MANUAL.ko.md) · [日本語](MANUAL.ja.md)

This is the friendly, take-your-time guide to YuTuTui!. It's written for people who don't live in a terminal — no jargon, every step spelled out. (If you *do* live in a terminal, the [README](README.md) has the fast version.)

One thing before anything else: **you can always press `?` inside the app.** It opens a cheat sheet of every key, and it always matches *your* settings. If you remember one thing from this manual, remember `?`.

---

## 1. First steps

### Install and open it

Follow the one-line install for your computer in the [README](README.md#install). On Windows,
you can now choose **YuTuTui!** in the Start Menu; it opens Windows Terminal and the player for
you. The tray icon's **Open Player** action does the same. On the other systems, open your terminal
app — that's the window where you type commands:

- **macOS** — the app called *Terminal* (or iTerm2 if you have it)
- **Windows** — *Windows Terminal* from the Start menu
- **Linux** — you know which one you like

Type this and press Enter:

```sh
ytt
```

That's the whole launch. The player appears in the window.

The first launch points to Search for ten seconds; press its displayed key (normally `s`) or click
**Search**. If mpv, yt-dlp, or ffmpeg is missing, use the setup card's copy/guide buttons and choose
**Check again** after installing it. The technical details remain available through `ytt doctor`.
On POSIX systems, guarded playback requires mpv 0.33 or newer. The interactive `ytt` player exits
immediately for a definitive Unix terminal or multiplexer loss. An ambiguous cursor reply or
unusable multiplexer query must be observed independently twice before shutdown. A liveness
output-gate conflict defers the probe; owner frame/control output has a separate seven-second
deadline, and a worker that
never returns is bounded by an eight-second watchdog. Retained Windows ConPTY/tmux-control brokers and repeated same-type tmux/Screen/Zellij nesting
cannot be distinguished from an attached client; use `ytt daemon` or a host-side lifetime
supervisor/lease there. The supported scope is in [terminal compatibility](docs/terminal-compatibility.md#terminal-lifetime-detection).

### Play your first song

1. Press **`s`** — a search box opens.
2. Type a song or artist name, press **`Enter`**. In any text field, **`←`** / **`→`** moves the cursor by one character and **`Ctrl+←`** / **`Ctrl+→`** by one word; **`Backspace`** deletes one character and **`Ctrl+Backspace`** the previous word.
   On an older or multiplexed terminal that sends `Ctrl+Backspace` and `Ctrl+H` as the same code, YuTuTui! safely reserves that ambiguous code for word deletion (and ignores it outside text fields) while the Delete Word binding is still at its default. See [keyboard input modes](docs/terminal-compatibility.md#keyboard-input-modes).
3. Move down the results with **`↓`**, press **`Enter`** on the one you want.

Music. If instead you got an error, type `ytt doctor` in the terminal — it checks your setup and tells you, in plain words, what to fix.

**Looking for more than songs?** In the search box, **`Ctrl+P`** cycles what it searches: **songs → YouTube playlists → artists**. A playlist row plays, queues (`\`) or imports (`p`) the whole list; an artist row opens that artist's page — top songs and albums/singles — where `Enter` plays and `Esc` returns to your results.

**Brand new to this?** In **Settings → General**, switch on **Beginner Mode** — the next launch adds an interactive, nine-step walkthrough that points out each part as you go. Its very first card asks which language you'd like: one button per language — **English**, **한국어**, **日本語** — each written in its own script, and highlighting an option previews the card in that language. Press `Enter` and the rest of the tour, and the whole app, switch to your pick (change it any time under **Settings → General → Language**). In retro mode that step simply explains the UI stays English and offers Continue / Skip.

### The five screens

YuTuTui! is five screens, each one key away:

| Key | Screen | What it's for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| — | **Player** | The now-playing screen: album art, lyrics, progress bar |
| `s` | **Search** | Find songs, albums, artists, stations |
| `l` | **Library** | Your favorites, history, downloads and playlists |
| `o` | **Settings** | Everything adjustable, including accounts |
| `g` | **DJ Gem** | Ask for music in plain words *(optional, see below)* |

`Esc` generally backs you out of wherever you are. The mouse works everywhere too — click anything, scroll the wheel to change volume.

### The player bar follows you

The now-playing controls — title, progress bar, transport, status — live in a bar docked to
the bottom of **every** screen, so you can pause or seek from Search or Library without
leaving. Press `Shift+B` (or click the `▼` / `▲` next to the footer's mouse hint) to tuck the bar
away on those screens and reclaim the rows; the Player screen always keeps it. If you
prefer the classic look with the controls at the top of the Player screen only, switch
*Settings › General › Player bar position* to **Top**.

Shrink the window far enough (below ~32×14 cells) and the whole app becomes a tiny
miniplayer — title, progress, transport — then springs back to the full layout as soon as
the window grows again. Nothing to configure; it just follows the window.

## 2. Everyday music (the normal mode)

### The keys you'll actually use

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `,` / `.` | Previous / next song |
| `←` / `→` | Rewind / fast-forward |
| `↑` / `↓` | Volume |
| `f` | Cycle the current song through like / dislike / unrated |
| `x` / `r` | Shuffle / cycle repeat |
| `c` | Show the queue (what plays next) |
| `Shift+L` | Lyrics, synced to the music; click a visible line to seek there |
| `z` / `Shift+Z` | Show lyrics 0.1s earlier / later |
| `v` | Music video in a floating window |
| `!` / `@` | Jump to the previous / next chapter (long mixes and podcasts) |
| `Shift+S` | Sleep timer: type minutes (or `off`), the volume fades out, playback pauses |
| `w` | Explain the selected queue recommendation, or the current track |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

When synced lyrics load, **`[ − 0.0s + ]`** appears at the lower right for three seconds. After it folds to **`[±]`**, click the handle to reopen it for three seconds; **`−/+`** fine-tunes the lyrics earlier / later in 0.1-second steps. Clicking any visible lyric line seeks to its synced position.

**Sound going to the wrong speakers?** Open **Settings → Playback → Audio output** to pick from the outputs the app detects on your machine; **Audio backend** exposes the underlying mpv audio options.

The mouse works throughout: **right-click** a row for a context menu (its gestures are remappable via `mouse_bindings` in `config.json`).

### Your Library

Press **`l`**. The Library has five tabs: **All**, **Favorites**, **History**, **Downloads**, and **Playlists**. Everything you favorite, play, download or collect ends up in one of them. Press **`n`** to start a new playlist of your own.

### Downloads — keep songs offline

On any song, press **`d`**: it's saved as a proper music file (cover art and title included) into your Music folder, and appears under Library → Downloads. **`Shift+D`** downloads a whole list or playlist at once. Downloaded songs play without internet — and they feed the Local Deck (chapter 4).

### DJ Gem *(optional)*

DJ Gem is the app's built-in music brain. It's optional and needs a free Gemini API key from Google — everything else in the app works without it.

- **Endless station:** press **`Ctrl+R`** and it keeps the queue filled with songs that fit what you're hearing.
- **Ask in words:** press **`g`** and type things like *"play some quiet piano"* or *"make me a rainy-day playlist"* — it can build the playlist right into your Library.

Recommended tracks carry a clickable **`?`** in the queue and beside Now Playing. With the queue open, **`w`** explains the selected row; otherwise it explains the current track. The card always shows where the recommendation came from. When DJ Gem supplied model detail it also shows the track's role, plain-language reasons and optional confidence; local station picks and other recommendations without that detail show their source alone.

To switch it on: get a free Gemini API key from Google, then paste it in **Settings → DJ Gem** and enable it.

---

## 3. Radio mode — the app becomes a radio tuner

Sometimes you don't want to pick songs. Radio mode turns the whole app into an internet-radio tuner with thousands of real, live stations.

### In and out

On the Player screen, press **`Alt+Shift+R`**. The app asks *"Switch to dedicated Radio mode?"* — confirm, and everything changes: the colors switch to a radio-only theme (that's on purpose — it's how you know where you are), and your music queue is safely tucked away, exactly as it was, until you come back.

Press **`Alt+Shift+R`** again to return to normal music mode. (One rule: Radio and the Local Deck can't be open at the same time — leave one before entering the other.)

### Finding a station

Press **`s`** and search, just like for songs — except now you're searching **Radio Browser**, a huge public directory of internet stations. Search for a genre ("jazz"), a country, or a station name, and press `Enter` to tune in.

Your Library (press `l`) also changes in radio mode: it shows just two tabs, **Radio Likes** and **Radio History** — your favorite stations and recently tuned ones. They're kept completely separate from your music favorites. Press **`f`** on a station to like it.

### While you listen

Live radio is *live*, so there's no rewinding. If your connection hiccups and you drift behind the broadcast, the app tells you — *"Live: 25s behind"* — and pressing **`r`** snaps you back to the live edge.

The best part: **press `i`** when a song catches your ear. A little card pops up telling you *what's playing right now*, using the station's own broadcast info. Inside that card:

- **`f`** saves the identified song to your *music* favorites (so you'll find it back in normal mode),
- **`g`** asks DJ Gem to tell you more or find similar songs.

There's also a recordings browser on **`Alt+Shift+E`**.

### Atlas — the globe

Press **`a`** (or click *Atlas globe* under the radio set piece) and the Player becomes a spinning globe of live stations, drawn right in your terminal with Braille dots — no image support needed, it works wherever the app does. Every dot is a station; the panel beside it lists what's in view.

- **Drag** to rotate, **flick** to send it coasting (with animations on), **wheel** to zoom. Keyboard: arrows or `h j k l` rotate, `+`/`-` zoom, `0` resets.
- **Click a dot** to tune it. **Click a country** (or press **`c`**) to browse its top stations — the country lights up.
- **`n`** / **`p`** step through the stations in view, **`Enter`** tunes the highlighted one, **`r`** tunes a random station you haven't heard lately, **`g`** jumps back to the one playing, **`f`** favorites it.
- **`/`** searches by name, country, language or tag; **`Tab`** moves between the globe and the list; **`G`** toggles the grid lines; **`R`** lets the globe turn by itself.
- **`q`** or **`Esc`** closes the globe. Space, `m`, `,` and `.` keep controlling playback while it's open.

Stations come from Radio Browser and are cached for a day. Some have no published coordinates; those get an approximate spot inside their country and say so. Settings → Playback has the Atlas options (renderer, how many stations to load, panel, coasting, grid, follow-playing, autorotate); pick the *ASCII* renderer if your font has no Braille.

---

## 4. Local Deck — your own music, beautifully

The Local Deck is a dedicated player for music that lives *on your computer*: your downloads and your own audio files. Browsing, Find and playback use those local files and never fall back to an online stream. Other features you have opted into — such as lyrics, scrobbling or update checks — may still use the network, so the Local Deck is not a whole-app airplane mode.

### In and out

Open the Library (**`l`**), then press **`Alt+Shift+L`**. The app asks *"Switch to Local Player mode?"* — confirm, and you're in an immersive shell built just for browsing local music. Press **`Alt+Shift+L`** again to leave.

The Local Deck has its own saved theme, separate from your normal and Radio themes. On a fresh install — or when upgrading a config that has no Local theme yet — it starts with **Local Launch**. Change and save the theme while you are in the Local Deck and it will remember that choice. Leaving restores your normal theme; returning, including after a restart, restores your saved Local theme.

### What you'll see

The Local Deck scans your download folder (it understands the *Artist / Album / track* layout) and organizes everything into sections. Press the **number keys** to jump between them:

**Home · Tracks · Albums · Artists · Genres · Folders · Smart Lists · Scan Errors · Import Sessions · Inbox**

- **Tracks / Albums / Artists / Genres** — your collection, sliced every way.
- **Folders** — browse exactly as the files sit on disk.
- **Smart Lists** — automatic collections.
- **Scan Errors** — files the scanner couldn't read, so nothing fails silently.
- **Import Sessions / Inbox** — where Spotify imports arrive for review (next chapter!).

### Finding anything in the Local Deck

Choose **Find** in the Local Deck navigation or press **`Ctrl+F`**. This is a separate, local-only search across **All, Tracks, Albums, Artists, Genres, Folders** and the locally playable part of **Playlists**. It never hands an empty result to YouTube or another provider. Pressing **`/`** outside Find still means something deliberately smaller: filter only the Local Deck section you are currently viewing.

Type ordinary words to require all of them, or put a phrase in quotes. You can narrow a query with `t:` (title), `ar:` (track artist), `al:` (album), `aa:` (album artist), `g:` (genre), `path:`, `fmt:`, `year:`, `is:`, `missing:` and `sort:`. For example, `ar:bjork year:1995..2001 sort:recent` searches a year range and puts the newest matches first. A query beginning with **`>`** offers safe Local Deck commands such as rescan, rebuild, queue and section shortcuts — it never runs a shell command.

Open **Refine** — or press **`/`** while the result list has focus — to choose the scope and the default sort without rewriting the query. (`/` typed in the Find input remains an ordinary path character.) Apply commits the change; Cancel or `Esc` throws the draft away. A `sort:` term in the query temporarily overrides Refine's default and removing it restores that default.

- On a track, `Enter` or double-click plays it now. On an album, artist, genre, folder or playlist, it opens the matching local tracks.
- **`a`** or **`\`** adds the selected track or collection to the queue; **`P`** plays it now.
- **`A`** adds the whole result mix; **`s`** shuffles and plays the whole result mix. The order follows the selected sort, duplicates are removed, and an exact confirmation appears before the 999-item queue limit would omit anything.
- Empty and no-result views offer local recovery actions such as Rescan, Add Music Folder and View Scan Errors — not an online fallback.

One workflow crosses that boundary on purpose: from an **Import Sessions** row, you can explicitly request a manual online candidate search. YuTuTui! asks before leaving the Local Deck; only after you confirm and the mode switch succeeds does it submit that one search in normal mode. Cancelling or a stale/failed switch submits nothing.

### Getting music in

- Every song you download with `d` / `Shift+D` shows up here automatically.
- You can add more folders to scan in Settings (Local Deck roots).
- Spotify imports can download straight into it — read on.

## 5. Moving in from Spotify — the full, gentle walkthrough

You can bring your Spotify playlists and liked songs into YuTuTui!. Nothing is guessed silently: every song is matched by its actual title, artist and album, and anything uncertain is set aside for *you* to decide.

**Where can the music go?** Two options:

1. **Into the app's own Library playlists** — works immediately, no YouTube account needed. This is what the in-app import does.
2. **Into your real YouTube Music account** (playlists or likes) — the command-line way, needs your YouTube sign-in cookies (see the README reference).

### 5a. One-time setup (~5 minutes)

Here's the honest reason this setup exists: Spotify only lets apps read your library if the app is registered with them, and their registration for personal apps ("Development Mode") only serves people the app owner explicitly lists. So instead of everyone sharing one app, *you create your own tiny personal one*. Under [Spotify's 2026 Dev-Mode rules](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/february-2026-migration-guide), its owner needs a Premium account, a new app gets one Client ID, and it can serve up to five allowlisted users. There is no secret password involved; you'll only copy one ID.

1. Go to **[developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)** in your browser and log in with your normal Spotify account.
2. Click **Create app**.
3. **App name** and **App description** can be anything — `yututui` is fine.
4. In **Redirect URIs**, type exactly:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:9271/callback
   ```

   and click **Add**. This must be letter-for-letter exact — the numbers `127.0.0.1`, not the word `localhost` (Spotify refuses that), and no extra slash at the end. This address just means "come back to the app on this computer" — nothing leaves your machine.
5. Where it asks **Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?**, tick **Web API**.
6. Accept the terms, click **Save**.
7. Open your new app → **Settings**, and copy the **Client ID** (a long string of letters and numbers). Ignore the "Client secret" — you don't need it.
8. Still in the app's settings, open **User Management** and add *yourself*: your name and the email of your Spotify account. This is the allowlist — without this step Spotify will answer "403" later. New Dev-Mode apps can list up to five users.

Done. You never have to do this again.

### 5b. Connect YuTuTui! to Spotify

In the app: **Settings (`o`) → Accounts → Spotify** → paste the Client ID → choose **Connect**. Your browser opens a Spotify page asking to approve — click approve, and the app says connected.

(Prefer typing? `ytt auth spotify --client-id <YOUR-ID>` does the same. On a machine with no browser, the approval link is copied to your clipboard and saved to `spotify_auth_url.txt` — open it on any device.)

### 5c. Import, inside the app

1. Go to **Settings → Accounts → "Import from Spotify…"**.
2. A picker opens with your Spotify playlists. Choose one.
3. Pick an **import mode** (there's a dropdown right there):

   | Mode | What it means |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Fast playlist** | Take confident matches *and* safe near-matches. Most songs land immediately. |
   | **Strict playlist** | Only take matches the app is sure about; everything else waits for your review. |
   | **Review first** | Match everything but write *nothing* yet — you approve it all later. |
   | **Music video playlist** | Build a separate Library playlist from official-family music-video matches. |

4. That's it — the import runs **in the background while your music keeps playing**. The status line shows the progress.

When it finishes, you'll see: *"Import finished … saved in Library → Playlists"*. The playlist is there, playable right away.

The music-video mode names its playlist `<original name> (Music Videos)`. It prefers YouTube Music's OMV / OfficialSourceMusic classifications and strongly corroborated official channels. That is a careful best-effort check, not a 100% guarantee — the public APIs do not publish one definitive “official music video” flag. Clearly ineligible user uploads are rejected; uncertain candidates wait for review.

### 5d. Reviewing the leftovers

Songs the app wasn't sure about are never guessed — they wait in the **Local Deck → Import Sessions** (and its **Inbox**). Go there (chapter 4), open the session, and go through the rows: each shows what Spotify had and what the best candidates are. Accept the ones that look right — or press **`Shift+A`** to accept all matched candidates at once. Rows can also retry their downloads or open candidate links so you can check with your own ears.

### 5e. The command-line version *(optional)*

If you're comfortable typing commands, the same machinery is available with more options:

```sh
ytt transfer import <spotify-url-or-id>      # playlist → your YTM account (needs cookies)
ytt transfer import liked --to likes         # Spotify likes → YTM likes, order kept
ytt transfer import <url> --to local:Name    # → the app's own Library playlist (no YTM account)
ytt transfer import <url> --media music-video
ytt transfer import liked --media music-video
                                             # playlist or Liked Songs → a separate official-family MV playlist
ytt transfer export ytm:<id> --to spotify    # create/append; not continuous sync
ytt transfer export ytm:<id> --to spotify:<22-character-playlist-id> --sync --dry-run
                                             # preview a destructive exact mirror
ytt transfer resume <job-id>                 # pick up after an interruption
ytt transfer backup --dir ~/music-backup     # back up every playlist to files
ytt transfer session <id>                    # inspect an import session
```

Imports are checkpointed: a rate limit, a closed lid or a power cut just means `resume` later — it continues where it stopped.

The ordinary `--to spotify` export uses Spotify's current `POST /me/playlists` API when it needs to create a destination, then appends missing tracks. It does not remove extras, reproduce duplicate positions, reorder later or keep syncing in the background.

The ID-targeted `--sync` form is deliberately stricter and destructive. It accepts only an existing playlist owned by the connected Spotify account. Run `--dry-run` first to see additions, removals and reordering. If any source row is unresolved or the source was truncated, the whole operation stops before changing Spotify. Otherwise the real run mirrors order, duplicates and removals exactly. Without `--yes`, ytt previews and asks before replacement; `ytt transfer resume <job-id>` refreshes that preview and asks again, while `resume <job-id> --yes` deliberately skips confirmation.

### If something goes wrong

The most common hiccups (403 "not allowlisted", INVALID_CLIENT, a busy port) all have one-line fixes in the **[README's troubleshooting section](README.md#troubleshooting)**.

---

## 6. Backing up your personal data

YuTuTui! can gather the portable parts of your setup and music taste into one versioned, human-readable JSON file. Inside the app, open **Settings (`o`) → General → Export personal data**. It writes to your computer's normal **Downloads** folder and tells you the completed filename.

You can do the same from a terminal:

```sh
ytt data export                         # save to the OS Downloads folder
ytt data export --to ~/existing-folder # choose an existing directory
```

The folder after `--to` must already exist; give a directory, not a filename. YuTuTui! will not create the folder or silently fall back to the current directory if Downloads cannot be found.

When the normal primary `ytt` app or daemon is running, the CLI asks that owner for its current in-memory state instead of reading a possibly stale file. An outdated, malformed, live-but-unreachable, or ambiguous owner stops the export rather than silently falling back to disk. Only when an advertised endpoint is provably stale and an exclusive data lock confirms no process owns the stores does the CLI recover with an offline snapshot. If `--new-instance` players are also open, the CLI exports only the advertised primary; export each secondary from its own Settings screen. An offline CLI export refuses to read the stores until every current-version ytt owner, including secondaries, is closed.

**What's included:** sanitized portable settings; track and radio favorites; listening and radio history; your Library playlists; safe track metadata and public catalog IDs; and the recommendation signals, artist affinities and station preferences that represent your taste.

**What's deliberately left out:**

- authentication cookies, API keys, OAuth tokens and account identifiers;
- filesystem paths and machine-specific audio settings;
- playable, origin, artwork and radio-stream URLs;
- downloaded or recorded music, download manifests and media sidecars;
- pending scrobbles, transfer jobs and reports, and session queues;
- AI usage logs, generated caches, artwork caches and application logs;
- managed-tool binaries and paths, desktop window geometry and recovery backups.

The export is **not encrypted**. It has no passwords or tokens, but it does contain your private listening history, so treat it as a personal file before uploading or sharing it.

### Bringing an export back in

```sh
ytt data import ~/Downloads/the-file.json              # preview only (the default)
ytt data import ~/Downloads/the-file.json --apply      # actually merge it
```

Nothing changes unless you pass `--apply`; without it you get a preview of what the merge *would* do. A file from a different setup is merged without deleting anything you already have. A file from *this* setup is merged by causal order, so re-importing an older export of your own will not undo newer listening.

Exports are written in schema 2 by default. `ytt data export --schema 1` writes the older format if you need to hand the file to an older copy of YuTuTui!.

YuTuTui! creates a new owner-only file and never overwrites an existing one. It also rejects a destination where an untrusted local account could create, replace, or delete the completed path. If the destination filesystem cannot enforce and verify these private permissions or ACLs, the export fails instead of leaving a broadly readable copy.

---

## 7. Keeping two computers in step

If you use YuTuTui! on more than one machine, it can keep your favorites, history, playlists and taste signals in step through a **WebDAV** folder — the kind of storage Nextcloud, ownCloud and most NAS boxes provide.

The important part: **the server never sees your data.** Everything is encrypted on your computer before it is uploaded, and only devices you have personally approved can read it. A WebDAV provider that reads its own disks learns nothing but file sizes and timestamps.

This is **off until you turn it on.**

### Setting up the first device

Inside the app: **Settings (`o`) → Sync**, which walks you through the same steps. From a terminal:

```sh
ytt sync setup
```

It asks for your WebDAV address (`https://…`, or a plain `http://` address only if it is on this same machine), your username and password, and a name for this device. Passwords are typed with the screen not showing them, and they are never accepted as part of the command itself.

At the end it writes a **recovery kit** — a small file, saved wherever you tell it. **Keep it somewhere safe and off this computer.** It is the material any future recovery would need, and nobody — including the author of YuTuTui! — can regenerate it for you. One honest caveat for now: there is no command yet that rebuilds a vault from the kit alone, so keep at least one connected machine rather than relying on the kit as a restore.

### Adding a second device

On the machine that already works:

```sh
ytt sync pair create
```

It prints a one-time connection code that is good for ten minutes. Then, on the new machine:

```sh
ytt sync pair join ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST-UV
```

The new machine asks for the same WebDAV details, then waits. Back on the first machine, approve it: that screen shows the joining machine's name and a short key fingerprint before you say yes. Only approve a name you recognise, and only while you are the one setting the other machine up. (The joining machine does not show you that fingerprint yet, so there is nothing to compare it against — the ten-minute one-time code is what keeps a stranger out.)

If you get interrupted halfway, nothing is lost:

```sh
ytt sync pair join --resume   # pick up where you left off, no code needed
ytt sync pair cancel          # throw away an unfinished attempt
```

### Day to day

```sh
ytt sync status          # one line: what state sync is in
ytt sync now             # merge this device with the folder right now
```

Status is always one of five things:

| It says | It means |
|---|---|
| **Off** | Sync is not set up on this device. |
| **Up to date** | Everything matches. Nothing to do. |
| **Syncing** | A merge is happening right now. |
| **Offline — will retry** | No connection. It will pick up by itself; you do not need to do anything. |
| **Needs attention** | Something needs a decision from you — the next line tells you what. |

### Managing devices

```sh
ytt sync devices                  # list active and removed devices
ytt sync revoke <DEVICE_ID>       # remove a device you no longer have
ytt sync recovery export --to DIR # save another copy of the recovery kit
ytt sync audit                    # what sync has done, with no private details
```

Removing a device is real: it re-locks your data so the removed machine cannot read anything uploaded afterwards. Do this if a laptop is lost or sold. It cannot un-read what that machine already downloaded.

---

## 8. Playing from your own music server

YuTuTui! can also play from one **OpenSubsonic** or **Navidrome** server — your own library, on your own hardware, alongside everything else in the app.

Inside the app: **Settings (`o`) → Music server**. From a terminal:

```sh
ytt server setup            # test and save a connection
ytt server status           # show the connection, with secrets left out
ytt server remove           # forget the server; your local data stays
```

`setup` asks for the address and either a password or an API key, prompted without showing them on screen. As with sync, secrets are never accepted as part of the command.

Your ratings and listening history flow back to the server. When a report cannot be delivered, it waits instead of being thrown away:

```sh
ytt server scrobbles list                  # reports waiting on a decision
ytt server scrobbles retry <OPAQUE_ID>     # try that one again
ytt server scrobbles mark-sent <OPAQUE_ID> # accept it as done, stop retrying
```

Playlists you create can hit the same situation — the server may or may not have finished creating one when the connection dropped:

```sh
ytt server playlists pending
ytt server playlists abandon <LOCAL_PLAYLIST_ID>   # forget the guard; deletes nothing
```

There is also an experimental, off-by-default mode for Navidrome's detailed history:

```sh
ytt server history enable --experimental
ytt server history disable      # also removes the extra saved password
```

It needs a second password of its own. Turning it off never affects ordinary server access.

## 9. When something goes wrong (anywhere)

First, always: quit the app and run

```sh
ytt doctor
```

It checks all the helper programs and tells you exactly what's missing and how to get it. For everything else — songs that won't play, missing album art, scrobbles, Spotify errors — the **[README troubleshooting tables](README.md#troubleshooting)** cover the known cases, sorted by symptom.

**YouTube suddenly rejects streams (403/429)?** That's YouTube's bot protection. Two things fix it for good, and `ytt doctor --verbose` now shows whether you have them:

- a **PO-token provider** ([`bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider)) — install it and add the yt-dlp config line it prints; or
- the **oauth plugin** ([`yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2`](https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2)) — run `yt-dlp --plugin-dirs … --username oauth --password ''` once and it keeps itself signed in.

Still stuck? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Ochichan/Yututui/issues) and just describe what you saw — mention your operating system.

*Happy listening! — and remember: `?`*
