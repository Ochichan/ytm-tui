YouTube Music in your terminal — fast, keyboard-driven, no browser tab eating your RAM, no ads. All behind a three-letter command: `ytt`. Rust + ratatui. MIT.

Stable enough for daily use, still moving fast.

### [▶ Live demo & the full feature tour → ochichan.github.io/Yututui](https://ochichan.github.io/Yututui/)

**📖 New to terminals?** The [friendly manual](MANUAL.md) walks through every mode — music, radio, the Local Deck, and the full Spotify move-in — step by step, no jargon. ([한국어](MANUAL.ko.md) · [日本語](MANUAL.ja.md))

## Install

The package-manager commands (brew, scoop, nix, yay) install `ytt` **and** its helpers
(mpv, yt-dlp, ffmpeg) in one go. The direct installer and the source build install `ytt`
only — they check for the helpers and tell you what's missing.

| OS | One command |
| --- | --- |
| **macOS** | `brew install Ochichan/tap/yututui` |
| **Windows** | `scoop bucket add extras; scoop bucket add yututui https://github.com/Ochichan/scoop-bucket; scoop install yututui` |
| **Linux** — any, with [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) | `nix run github:Ochichan/Yututui` |
| **Linux** — Arch | `yay -S yututui-bin` |
| **Linux** — any other | Download and run the installer below |
| **From source** | `./install.sh --build` (needs [Rust](https://rustup.rs)) |

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ochichan/Yututui/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows direct installer:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ochichan/Yututui/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

<details>
<summary><b>Verify what you download</b> <i>(optional)</i></summary>

Every release ships `checksums.txt` (SHA-256) and GitHub build-provenance attestations.
To avoid running an installer fetched from a moving branch, pin it to the latest release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Ochichan/Yututui/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Checksums (artifact + checksums.txt in the same directory):
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing checksums.txt        # macOS: shasum -a 256 -c

# Provenance — proves the artifact came from this repo's release workflow (GitHub CLI):
gh attestation verify yututui-linux-x64.tar.gz --repo Ochichan/Yututui
```

</details>

On Windows, launch **YuTuTui!** from the Start Menu. The tray companion opens Windows Terminal
and starts `ytt` for you; its right-click menu also has **Open Player**. Double-clicking
`ytt.exe` directly is supported too, and the console stays open after exit so an error is not
lost. macOS offers the same **Open Player** action from its menu-bar companion. Linux keeps the
lightweight native path: run `ytt` from your terminal or make a desktop launcher for that command.

Then run `ytt`. If anything's off, `ytt doctor` tells you exactly what to fix — more in [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

<details>
<summary><b>Tray companion (macOS / Windows)</b></summary>

macOS and Windows releases include `yututray`, the menu-bar / notification-area mini player.

| Channel | What gets installed | How to start the tray |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS Homebrew | `ytt`, `yututray`, runtime tools | `yututray --background` |
| Windows Scoop | `ytt.exe`, `yututray.exe`, runtime tools, Start Menu shortcut | `yututray --background` or **YuTuTray!** |
| Direct installers / source build scripts | `ytt`; macOS/Windows also get `yututray` | `yututray --background` |
| Linux | `ytt` with MPRIS media integration | no separate tray app |

Start-at-login is opt-in: `yututray --install-startup`.

`yututray` and `yututray --background` start tray-only, and `--mini` opens the native mini player.
Launching the bare
command again asks the existing instance to show its mini player instead of creating a second tray
icon. On Windows, left-click
toggles the mini player and right-click opens the menu; macOS keeps the native menu on the status
item and exposes the mini player from **Show Mini Player**.

The unpinned mini player behaves like a popover and hides after focus moves away. Pinning keeps it
visible, always on top, and restores its monitor-relative position. Tray-only and mini-only modes
stay out of the taskbar/Dock and app switcher.

</details>

### Runtime tools

YuTuTui! uses **mpv** for playback, **yt-dlp** for search/stream resolution, and **ffmpeg** for
download post-processing. Packaged installs include them. If a direct or source install is
missing one, the app shows a friendly setup card with a copyable OS command, setup guide, and
**Check again** button instead of exposing a process error. `ytt doctor` remains the detailed
diagnostic command. POSIX systems require **mpv 0.33 or newer** for the inherited lifetime lease.

`ytt` routes mpv launches through a private guardian. The guardian uses an owner heartbeat; POSIX
adds an inherited mpv `fd://` IPC lease, Linux also adds `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`, and Windows instead
uses kill-on-close Job Objects. These bind mpv to the `ytt` owner. The
standalone Unix TUI also fails closed when it loses a recognized direct/conmon PTY or a supported
tmux/screen/Zellij client; an inaccessible or ambiguous multiplexer query must fail twice before
shutdown. Normal Windows console-control events are handled too. A retained ConPTY/tmux-control
broker and repeated same-type tmux/Screen/Zellij nesting cannot be proven detached from inside the client; use `ytt daemon`
or a host-side lifetime supervisor/lease for those cases. See
[terminal compatibility](docs/terminal-compatibility.md#terminal-lifetime-detection).

## Quick start

```sh
ytt
```

On a new profile, a ten-second hint points to **Search**. Press the displayed search key
(normally `s`) or click **Search**; completing the hint once keeps later launches clean.

1. Press **`s`**, type a song, hit **`Enter`**.
2. Move with **`↑`/`↓`**, press **`Enter`** to play.
3. Press **`?`** anytime for the full, always-current key list.

That's it. Music.

**New to terminals?** Switch on **Beginner Mode** (Settings → General) and the next launch adds an interactive, nine-step walkthrough — it starts by letting you pick the UI language (English / 한국어 / 日本語) — plus the [friendly manual](MANUAL.md) covers every mode at your own pace.

## Tour

Every feature below is shown live, in detail, on the **[feature tour](https://ochichan.github.io/Yututui/)**.

### The player — real album art & time-synced lyrics

Actual cover images drawn right in the terminal (Kitty/Sixel/iTerm2, auto-detected — pick Standard, High or Original quality in Settings); **`Shift+L`** scrolls the lyrics underneath. Click any visible lyric line to seek there, or use **`z`** / **`Shift+Z`** to show the lyrics 0.1 seconds earlier / later. When lyrics load, **`[ − 0.0s + ]`** appears for three seconds; after it folds to **`[±]`**, click the handle to reopen it for three seconds and use **`−/+`** for fine adjustment. The player controls dock to the bottom of every screen (collapse them with **`Shift+B`**; the classic top layout is one setting away), the art stays centered in whatever space is left, and shrinking the window below ~32×14 turns the whole app into a tiny miniplayer that springs back when the window grows.

### Seven catalogs, one search box

**`Tab`** in Search flips between YouTube Music, SoundCloud, Audius, Jamendo, Internet Archive, Radio Browser and your OpenSubsonic music server — or all at once, every result tagged `[SRC]`.

![Searching across seven catalogs from one box](docs/media/sources.png)
![Search results with album art in the terminal](docs/media/search.png)

### DJ Gem streaming

**`Ctrl+R`** builds an endless station around what you're hearing. Recommended tracks carry a clickable **`?`** in the queue and beside Now Playing. Press **`w`** with the queue open to explain its selected row; anywhere else, it explains the current track. The card always names the recommendation source and, when DJ Gem supplied them, adds its role, plain-language reasons and confidence. Picks made without model detail show the source alone.

-->

### DJ Gem assistant *(optional)*

**`g`**, then ask in plain words: *"play some lo-fi", "make me a rainy-day playlist"*. Needs a free Gemini key; everything else works without it.

> 🖼️ *GIF coming soon.*
<!-- 📸 TO FILL: add docs/media/assistant.gif, delete the "coming soon" line above, then uncomment:
![Asking the DJ Gem assistant for music in plain words](docs/media/assistant.gif)
-->

### The music video, floating over your terminal

**`v`** opens it in a small mpv window; *Auto-continue videos* hands each video off to the next track's, and the mpv window answers `Space`, `.`, `,`, `q`, `f`, `m`.

> 🖼️ *GIF coming soon.*
<!-- 📸 TO FILL: add docs/media/video.gif, delete the "coming soon" line above, then uncomment:

### Radio mode — and it knows the song

**`Alt+Shift+R`** turns the whole app into an internet-radio tuner; press **`i`** and Gemini names what's playing on the live stream, **`f`** favorites it. Press **`a`** for **Atlas**: a rotatable, zoomable globe of live stations drawn in Braille dots — drag, flick, wheel, click a signal to tune, click a country to browse — with no image protocol required.

<!-- 📸 TO FILL: add docs/media/radio-id.gif, then uncomment:
![Pressing i to identify the song playing on live radio](docs/media/radio-id.gif)
-->

### Library, queue & downloads

Build playlists in the Library (or let DJ Gem build them), pop the queue with **`c`**, and **`d`** saves a tagged m4a with cover art — **`Shift+D`** grabs the whole list.

![The Library with playlists, favorites and history](docs/media/library.png)
![The queue popup over the player](docs/media/queue.png)
![Downloads: tagged m4a files with cover art, played offline](docs/media/downloads.png)

### Local Deck — an offline player for everything on disk

**`Alt+Shift+L`** in the Library opens an immersive player for your downloads and local files — albums, artists, genres and smart lists. Choose **Find** or press **`Ctrl+F`** to search tracks, albums, artists, genres, folders and locally playable playlist entries without an online fallback; **`/`** still filters only the section you're viewing. Refine the scope or sort, open a collection, or play/enqueue one result or the whole result mix.

Local playback and Find use only files already on your computer. Other opt-in integrations may still use the network, and the manual online-candidate search in **Import Sessions** explicitly asks before leaving the Local Deck. The Local Deck also remembers its own theme separately from normal and Radio modes: a fresh or older installation starts it with **Local Launch**, then restores whichever Local theme you save there. The [manual](MANUAL.md) has the full tour.

![The Local Deck browsing local albums](docs/media/localdeck.png)

### Control from anywhere

Media keys, macOS Control Center, Windows SMTC + tray mini player, Linux MPRIS, `ytt -r` from any shell — or a fully headless daemon.

### Make it yours

14 themes with all 34 color roles hex-editable, 40 animations — from shooting stars and a spinning ASCII donut up to full-canvas showpieces (fireworks, Game of Life, pipes, plasma) — a 10-band EQ with presets, your pick of audio-output device, plus loudness normalization. The UI itself speaks English, 한국어 and 日本語 — Settings → General → **Language** cycles through all three.

![The 10-band EQ with presets](docs/media/eq.png)

### Retro mode

One toggle makes everything CP437-safe for a bare Linux console or a crusty SSH session — album art included, as honest ASCII art. Retro also pins the UI language to English — CP437 has no CJK glyphs.

![Retro mode with ASCII album art](docs/media/retro.png)

### Spotify moves in with one command

`ytt transfer import <url>` — checkpointed, resumable, with a match report for anything ambiguous. Setup in the [reference](#reference) below, or let the [manual](MANUAL.md) hold your hand through the whole thing.

### The app remembers the keys

**`?`** opens a live cheat sheet that reflects *your* bindings — app actions are rebindable, the whole UI is mouse-aware, and safety/modal keys stay fixed and dependable.

![The live keybinding cheat sheet](docs/media/help.png)
![Beginner Mode's interactive walkthrough](docs/media/onboarding.png)
![Right-click context menu on a track row](docs/media/context-menu.png)

## Essential keys

Press **`?`** in-app for the complete live cheat sheet — it reflects *your* bindings, and app actions can be changed in Settings → Hotkeys (safety and modal keys remain fixed). The core:

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| `,` / `.` | Previous / next (also inside the mpv video window) |
| `←` / `→` · `↑` / `↓` | Seek · volume |
| `s` | Search (`Tab` picks the catalog) |
| `l` / `c` | Library / queue |
| `x` / `r` | Shuffle / cycle repeat |
| hold `↑`/`↓` · `Shift`+`↑`/`↓` | Fast-scroll a list (accelerates) · extend the selection |
| `f` / `d` | Rate like/dislike (or favorite a selected Library row) / download |
| `Shift+D` | Download the whole list / playlist |
| `Shift+L` | Synced lyrics; click a visible line to seek there |
| `z` / `Shift+Z` | Show lyrics 0.1s earlier / later (`[±]` reopens `−/+` for 3s) |
| `v` | Music-video overlay |
| `!` / `@` | Jump to the previous / next chapter (mpv-style) |
| `Shift+S` | Sleep timer — set minutes (or `off`), fade-out, then pause |
| `Shift+B` | Collapse / expand the docked control box |
| `←` / `→` · `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` | Move by one character · one word in a text field |
| `Backspace` / `Ctrl+Backspace` | Delete a character / previous word in a text field |
| `Ctrl+H` | Return to the Player (on legacy ambiguous terminals, the safe text-edit fallback takes priority) |
| `Ctrl+R` | DJ Gem streaming |
| `w` | Explain the selected queue recommendation, or the current track |
| `g` | DJ Gem assistant |
| `o` | Settings |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

> **Korean keyboard?** Shortcuts understand 두벌식 jamo (`ㅂ` works like `q`) — no need to switch input. Prefer the mouse? Everything is clickable, and the wheel rides the volume. Drag across rows to select a range — in Search results just like the Library — and `Ctrl`+click (`⌘`+click on macOS) toggles single rows in and out of the selection. Right-click a row for a context menu, and remap any gesture under `mouse_bindings` in `config.json`. The footer **mouse** button opens the full mouse cheat sheet.

## Troubleshooting

First aid, always: **`ytt doctor`** checks mpv, yt-dlp and ffmpeg and tells you exactly what to fix. `ytt doctor --verbose` digs deeper; `ytt doctor terminal --json` reports what your terminal can do.

### Playback

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Nothing plays, or it errors on play | mpv or yt-dlp missing — run `ytt doctor`. |
| Sound goes to the wrong device | Settings → Playback → **Audio output** picks from the detected local outputs; **Audio backend** exposes the mpv options. |
| Worked yesterday, not today | YouTube changed something — `ytt tools update`, then `ytt tools status --why`; if a managed update is bad, `ytt tools use system`. |
| Several tracks fail with 403/429 or "YouTube rejected the stream" | YouTube's bot protection. Run `ytt doctor --verbose` (it now reports PO-token/oauth readiness), check the [cookies reference](#reference), and make sure a supported JS runtime is available; `ytt tools status --why` shows the active yt-dlp. A [PO-token provider](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#po-token-guide) or the [oauth plugin](https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2) usually fixes it for good. |
| A specific song won't play | It may need sign-in — see the cookies section in the [reference](#reference). |
| The app runs a different yt-dlp than your shell | That's by design (managed copy vs `PATH`) — see *yt-dlp selection* in the [reference](#reference). |

### Install & startup

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `ytt: command not found` | Open a fresh terminal; still stuck, add the `PATH` line the installer printed. |
| Direct installer / source build is missing helpers | The one-line installers only install `ytt` itself — `ytt doctor` lists what to install and how. |

### Display & terminals

Terminal support varies by emulator — YuTuTui! probes capabilities and falls back where possible. Check your environment with `ytt doctor terminal --json` and compare with the [terminal compatibility matrix](docs/terminal-compatibility.md).

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| No album art | Off by default: Settings → General → **Album art**, then restart. |
| Album art or zoom behaves differently by terminal | Run `ytt doctor terminal --json` and compare with the [terminal matrix](docs/terminal-compatibility.md). |
| A terminal-liveness error closes the TUI | Run `ytt doctor terminal --json` and keep the error's failure class/stage. EOF/HUP and a confirmed multiplexer detach are immediate; ambiguous cursor replies and owner-layer queries need two independent observations. Liveness output-gate contention defers the probe, while owner frame/control output has its own seven-second deadline. Use `ytt daemon` only when playback should outlive the terminal. |
| `Ctrl+Backspace` acts like `Ctrl+H`, or Player navigation is suppressed | See [keyboard input modes](docs/terminal-compatibility.md#keyboard-input-modes). Direct modern terminals negotiate an exact protocol when supported; legacy/multiplexed sessions reserve ambiguous `^H` for safe word deletion while that binding remains at its default. |
| Album art looks blocky in VS Code / Apple Terminal | Those terminals have no image protocol — halfblocks are the intended fallback there. |
| Bare Linux console or an old SSH session looks broken | Switch on retro mode (Settings → Graphics): everything redraws CP437-safe, album art becomes ASCII art. |
| `v` (music video) does nothing over SSH / a bare TTY | The video overlay is an mpv GUI window — it needs a desktop session. |

### Spotify import

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Spotify 403 / "not allowlisted" | Add your own account under *User Management* in your Spotify app dashboard, and check the Client ID for typos. |
| Browser shows INVALID_CLIENT / redirect mismatch | The redirect URI must match **exactly**: `http://127.0.0.1:9271/callback` — IP not `localhost`, correct port, no trailing slash. |
| "could not listen on 127.0.0.1:9271" | That port is busy. Set `spotify.redirect_port` in `config.json` and update the dashboard redirect URI to match. |
| Clicked Connect but no browser opened | On headless/SSH the auth URL is copied to your clipboard and saved to `spotify_auth_url.txt` — paste it into any browser to approve. |
| Spotify import "needs a YouTube Music cookie" | Importing into a YTM playlist/likes needs sign-in; importing into a local Library playlist works without one. See the cookies section in the [reference](#reference). |

### Accounts, scrobbling & OS integration

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Scrobbles not appearing | Check Settings → Accounts; the daemon reads accounts at start — restart it after connecting. |
| No Control Center / SMTC / MPRIS entry | Settings → Playback → **OS media controls**; it publishes once something has played. |
| Flyout shows "Unknown app" / two entries | Run `ytt register-media-identity` once (two entries = mpv's own media session; auto-disabled on mpv ≥ 0.39). |
| No desktop update notification | Update notices still appear in About/status; desktop notifications are best-effort and depend on terminal, tmux, and OS notification support. |

### Everything else

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| DJ Gem won't respond | Add a free Gemini key in Settings → DJ Gem and switch **Enable DJ Gem** on. |
| Remapped a key into chaos | Settings → General → **Reset keybindings**. |

Still stuck? [Open an issue](https://github.com/Ochichan/Yututui/issues) and mention your OS.

## Reference

<details>
<summary><b>Remote control & daemon</b></summary>

Once `ytt` is playing, control it from any shell:

```sh
ytt -r pp                  # play / pause      (aliases: toggle, play, pause)
ytt -r next / prev         # skip around
ytt -r volume 40           # set volume; also: up / down
ytt -r seek-to 90          # jump to 1:30
ytt -r streaming on        # endless streaming: on / off / toggle
ytt -r play "lofi"         # daemon: search and play the first result
ytt -r status              # one-line "now playing" (--json for scripts)
ytt -r info                # owner mode, protocol and capabilities (never the token)
ytt -r queue-list          # numbered queue; the current row starts with >
ytt -r queue-play 2        # play queue row 2 (queue numbers start at 1)
ytt -r settings-show       # compact, non-secret settings summary
ytt -r watch --json        # live player/queue/system events as NDJSON (the default topics)
ytt -r watch all           # all published topics: player, queue, settings, system
```

Media keys on i3 / sway: `bindsym XF86AudioPlay exec ytt -r pp`.

Remote control stays on the same machine and is scoped to the current OS user through a private
Unix socket or Windows named pipe. It is not a LAN/HTTP remote: never share or expose its runtime
directory. Queue numbers shown by `queue-list` are 1-based.

For terminal-free playback, run the headless daemon:

```sh
ytt daemon start --resume   # restore the saved queue/session and play
ytt daemon stop             # stop the daemon and reap mpv
```

The daemon keeps streaming, scrobbling and OS media controls working. Launching `ytt` twice won't start a second player (`ytt --new-instance` if you really want two). Full lists: `ytt -r --help`, `ytt daemon --help`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Scrobbling setup (Last.fm / ListenBrainz)</b></summary>

`ytt` scrobbles what you actually listen to — the standard half-track/4-minute rule, like→love sync, and an offline queue that hits disk *before* any network attempt, so crashes lose nothing. Works in the TUI and the daemon alike.

- **Last.fm** — Settings → **Accounts** → approve in the browser, or `ytt auth lastfm`. Self-built binaries can set `scrobble.lastfm.api_key` / `api_secret` in `config.json` ([create an API account](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)).
- **ListenBrainz** — paste your [user token](https://listenbrainz.org/settings/) into Settings → Accounts, or `ytt auth listenbrainz <token>`. Self-hosted: set `scrobble.listenbrainz.api_url`.
- Undelivered listens wait in `scrobble-queue.jsonl` next to your config and flush automatically.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Spotify import / export</b></summary>

```sh
ytt auth spotify --client-id <YOUR-CLIENT-ID>   # one-time PKCE browser connect
ytt transfer import <spotify-url-or-id>          # → a new YTM playlist
ytt transfer import liked --to likes             # Spotify likes → YTM likes (order kept)
ytt transfer import <url> --media music-video    # → a separate official-family MV playlist
ytt transfer import liked --media music-video    # the same MV mode for Spotify Liked Songs
ytt transfer import <url> --policy strict        # stricter review-heavy matching
ytt transfer export ytm:<id> --to spotify        # create/append on Spotify (not a live sync)
ytt transfer export ytm:<id> --to spotify:<22-character-playlist-id> --sync --dry-run
                                                  # preview an exact mirror into an existing playlist
ytt transfer backup --dir ~/music-backup --csv   # every YTM playlist → JSON (+CSV)
ytt transfer resume <job-id>                     # continue after a rate-limit/abort
```

Or stay in the TUI: Settings → **Accounts** → *Import from Spotify…* while the music keeps playing. Its fourth mode, **Music video playlist**, writes a separate playlist into Library → Playlists.

**One-time setup (~5 min).** Spotify apps in Development Mode only serve accounts you explicitly allowlist, so everyone brings their own personal app. Under [Spotify's 2026 Dev-Mode rules](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/february-2026-migration-guide), the app owner needs Premium, a new app gets one Client ID, and it can serve up to five allowlisted users. There is no client *secret* — PKCE doesn't use one.

1. Sign in at [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and click **Create app**.
2. Give it any **App name** and **App description** (e.g. `yututui`).
3. Under **Redirect URIs**, add exactly `http://127.0.0.1:9271/callback` and click **Add**. It must be the loopback IP literal `127.0.0.1`, **never `localhost`** (Spotify rejects `localhost`). Using a different port? Set `spotify.redirect_port` in `config.json` and match it here.
4. Under **Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?**, tick **Web API**.
5. Accept the terms and **Save**.
6. Open the app → **Settings** and copy the **Client ID** (you do *not* need the Client secret).
7. Open **User Management** (in the app's settings) and add your own account — your name plus the email on your Spotify account. New Dev-Mode apps serve up to five such allowlisted users.
8. In ytt: **Settings → Accounts → Spotify**, paste the Client ID, and choose **Connect** (or run `ytt auth spotify --client-id <ID>`). Your browser opens Spotify's approval page — approve it and you're done. On headless/SSH where no browser opens, the URL is copied to your clipboard and saved to `spotify_auth_url.txt`, so you can open it on any device.

Matching is metadata-based (NFKC-normalized, CJK-safe) and resolves Spotify imports cache-first, album-aware, and YTM-catalog-first before falling back to public YouTube videos. The CLI default is `--policy balanced`; use `--policy strict` for conservative review-heavy matching, `--policy aggressive` for fewer review rows, and `--allow-user-videos` only if generic public uploads are acceptable. Anything still ambiguous lands in the job report instead of being silently guessed — re-run with `--take-best` / `--min-score`, or preview big playlists with `--dry-run` and then `ytt transfer resume <job-id>`.

`--media music-video` works with a Spotify playlist or `liked` and creates a separate `<source> (Music Videos)` playlist unless you supply a destination name. It prefers YouTube Music's OMV / OfficialSourceMusic classifications and strongly corroborated official channels. That is a best-effort official-family check, not a 100% guarantee: the public APIs do not expose a definitive “official music video” flag. Hard-rejected user uploads cannot be forced through review, and unresolved candidates stay in the report.

The ordinary `--to spotify` export is intentionally non-destructive: it finds or creates a playlist (creation uses Spotify's current `POST /me/playlists` API) and appends missing matches. It does not remove Spotify-only tracks, reproduce duplicate positions, reorder the playlist, or keep watching for later edits.

For a destructive, one-shot exact mirror, use an explicit playlist ID with `--to spotify:<22-character-playlist-id> --sync`. Only a playlist owned by the connected account is accepted. Run `--dry-run` first: the preview shows additions, removals and reordering, and nothing is changed if even one source row is unresolved or the source was truncated. The real run preserves source order and duplicate occurrences and removes destination-only tracks. Without `--yes` it previews and asks before replacing anything; `ytt transfer resume <job-id>` builds a fresh preview and asks again (`resume <job-id> --yes` deliberately skips that confirmation).

<summary><b>Sign-in cookies & file locations</b></summary>

**PO tokens & oauth — beyond cookies.** When YouTube starts rejecting *public* streams too (HTTP 403/429 "YouTube rejected the stream"), the fix is usually a **PO-token provider**: install [`bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider) and add the yt-dlp config line it prints. A more durable sign-in is the [`yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2`](https://github.com/coletdjnz/yt-dlp-youtube-oauth2) plugin (`yt-dlp --plugin-dirs ... --username oauth --password ''` once, then it refreshes itself). `ytt doctor --verbose` now reports which of these are ready on your machine.

**Cookies (optional).** Public songs play anonymously — only members-only/region-locked tracks and account playlists need this. Export your YouTube Music cookies in **Netscape format** to `~/Music/yututui/cookies.txt` (Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Music\yututui\cookies.txt`) and restart. **Treat that file like a password**, and export the *incognito way*: sign in inside a private window, export `cookies.txt` from that tab, then close the window — a session whose browser is gone never gets rotated or signed out. A good export has `SAPISID`/`SID` lines in it.

**Config & data.**

- Config: `~/Library/Application Support/yututui/config.json` (macOS) · `~/.config/yututui/config.json` (Linux) · `%APPDATA%\yututui\config.json` (Windows) — with `playlists.json`, `scrobble-queue.jsonl` and `transfers/` alongside.
- Downloads: `~/Music/yututui` — change via the **Download dir** setting or `YTM_DOWNLOAD_DIR`.
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `YTM_DOWNLOAD_DIR` override saved settings at launch.

**Portable personal-data export.** Choose **Settings (`o`) → General → Export personal data**, or run:

```sh
ytt data export                         # save to the OS Downloads folder
ytt data export --to ~/existing-folder # choose an existing directory
```

`--to` takes a directory, not a filename, and does not create it. A destination where another local account could replace the finished file is rejected. The result is a new, owner-private, never-overwritten, versioned JSON file containing sanitized portable settings; track and radio favorites; listening and radio history; playlists and safe track metadata/public catalog IDs; and recommendation signals, artist affinities and station preferences.

If the primary app or daemon is running, the CLI exports that owner's current in-memory state. With additional `--new-instance` players, the CLI still exports only the advertised primary; use each secondary's Settings screen for its live state. Offline export refuses to read the stores while any current-version ytt owner is active.

It excludes authentication cookies, API keys, OAuth tokens and account identifiers; every filesystem path and machine-specific audio setting; playable, origin, artwork and radio-stream URLs; downloaded/recorded media, manifests and sidecars; pending scrobbles, transfer jobs/reports and session queues; AI usage logs, generated caches, artwork caches and application logs; managed-tool binaries and paths, desktop geometry and recovery backups.

The JSON is **not encrypted** and still contains private listening history, so store or share it accordingly. See the export/import reference below for bringing one back in.

<summary><b>yt-dlp selection</b></summary>

**yt-dlp keeps itself fresh.** YouTube changes weekly, so `ytt` maintains its own current yt-dlp (SHA-256-verified from github.com) and uses whichever of {managed, system} is newer. It may therefore run a different yt-dlp than the one your shell prints with `yt-dlp --version`. To see the actual choice and candidates:

```sh
ytt tools status --why
```

Recovery commands:

```sh
ytt tools update              # refresh the managed copy now
ytt tools use system          # ignore managed yt-dlp and use PATH
ytt tools use managed         # pin the installed managed copy
ytt tools use /path/to/yt-dlp # pin a specific executable
ytt tools unpin               # return to normal managed/system selection
```

`YTM_YTDLP` is still the strongest override. If you change it in your OS settings, open a fresh terminal or unset it before expecting `ytt tools use ...` to take over.

The app's own yt-dlp calls ignore your yt-dlp config file by default, so options meant for shell downloads do not break parsed output. Set `YTM_YTDLP_USER_CONFIG=1` to re-enable your yt-dlp config for app-parsed calls. Playback through mpv's `ytdl_hook` still honors your yt-dlp config; only search, playlist fetches, metadata, prefetch resolution, and downloads ignore it by default.

<summary><b>Encrypted sync across devices</b></summary>

Keep favorites, history, playlists and taste signals in step across machines through a WebDAV
folder (Nextcloud, ownCloud, most NAS boxes). Everything is encrypted locally before upload —
the server stores ciphertext and learns nothing but sizes and timestamps. Off until you enable it.

```sh
ytt sync setup                        # create the vault; writes a required recovery kit
ytt sync status [--json]              # Off / Up to date / Syncing / Offline — will retry / Needs attention
ytt sync now                          # merge local and remote state now

ytt sync pair create                  # print a ten-minute, one-time connection code
ytt sync pair join <CODE>             # on the new device; approve on the old one
ytt sync pair join --resume           # continue an interrupted join, no code needed
ytt sync pair cancel                  # discard an unfinished local join

ytt sync devices [--json]             # active and removed devices
ytt sync revoke <DEVICE_ID>           # remove a device and rotate the encrypted checkpoint
ytt sync recovery export --to <DIR>   # verify and copy the recovery kit
ytt sync audit [--json]               # redacted sync audit log
```

WebDAV credentials are prompted with echo disabled and are never accepted as arguments. The
endpoint must be HTTPS unless it is loopback. Status and audit output deliberately omit
endpoints, paths and secrets.

Self-signed or private-PKI endpoints can pin a custom CA (PEM) per connection; the PEM never
leaves the device and is never logged. Custom-CA trust is covered by an automated test that is
green on Linux, Windows, and hosted macOS 15. One local macOS machine recorded a Secure
Transport rejection (`errSSLClosedAbort -9806`, 2026-07-26) that CI has never reproduced — if
custom-CA trust fails for you, please report it with your macOS version.

**Keep the recovery kit off this machine.** Nobody can regenerate it for you. Note that no
command rebuilds a vault from the kit alone yet, so keep at least one approved device rather
than treating the kit as a restore. Revoking a device re-locks everything uploaded afterwards,
but cannot un-read what that device already downloaded.

Inside the app the same flow lives under **Settings (`o`) → Sync**.

<summary><b>Your own music server (OpenSubsonic / Navidrome)</b></summary>

```sh
ytt server setup                                   # test and save one server connection
ytt server status [--json]                         # redacted connection status
ytt server remove                                  # forget the profile; keep local data

ytt server scrobbles list [--json]                 # playback reports awaiting a decision
ytt server scrobbles retry <OPAQUE_ID>             # treat one as unsent and retry
ytt server scrobbles mark-sent <OPAQUE_ID>         # treat one as sent without retrying

ytt server playlists pending [--json]              # playlist creates awaiting a decision
ytt server playlists abandon <LOCAL_PLAYLIST_ID>   # forget the guard; deletes neither copy

ytt server history enable --experimental           # detailed Navidrome history (off by default)
ytt server history disable                         # also removes its saved password
```

Passwords and API keys are prompted with echo disabled and are never accepted as arguments.
Password auth uses a fresh per-request salted token — the cleartext password is never sent.
Experimental detailed history needs its own password and never disables standard server access.

Inside the app: **Settings (`o`) → Music server**.

<summary><b>Personal data export & import</b></summary>

```sh
ytt data export [--to DIR] [--schema 1|2]   # versioned JSON, no credentials or media
ytt data import <FILE>                      # preview the merge (the default)
ytt data import <FILE> --apply              # atomically apply it
```

The export is not encrypted and contains your listening history — treat it as a personal file.
A foreign dataset merges without deleting anything; a bundle from this same dataset merges by
causal order, so re-importing your own older export cannot roll back newer listening.
